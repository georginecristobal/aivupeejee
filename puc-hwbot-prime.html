                            <p> So, first an apology. I effectively forgot to enter the last one. My good 775 board died then uni started and, well, I was busy. However, it's that time again with this Novice Nimble ( running until the 10th of December. Stage Hardware Benchmark Subs So far Subs Needed Notes :------: :----------: :-------------: :-------------: :----------------: :------: 1 Intel 2-8 cores CB15 2-core by Firstshadow (http://hwbot.org/submission. So far team comp has been going pretty well for us, we've got nearly every stage covered. However as we go into the last week there's still a few stages with spotty coverage so I'm making a call for the last few cpus we need. We need still need scores for Hwbot Prime ( and Geekbench 3 ( on a 4770k. We also need SuperPi (http://oc-espo. I have a 4.8 @ 1.424v 6700k from SiliconLottery that I bought from him in a sponsorship discount deal when I was still very into HWBOT.ORG, but I am upgrading to a binned 7700k from my friend in a few days, so I need to sell this to pay for the new chip. The 1.424v 4.8 it was rated for was pre-delid, I had him delid it and put Thermal Grizzly Kryonaut then re-seal it, I was unhappy with temps so after I got it, I delidded it myself and put Coolaboratory Liquid Ultra under the IHS, which dropped. Members of /r/overclocking's HWBOT team ( it's time for this years HWBOT TEAM CUP! ( What is HWBOT TEAM CUP? HWBOT Team Cup is a team oriented overclocking competition hosted by hwbot.org. Almost all competitions on hwbot are not team oriented, where each person competes individually, so the goal of this competition is to get the team spirit going, so that people work together to score So I had to use up the rest of my LN2 because I have another delivery on Tuesday. and I thought I'd try AM3+. I set a couple of personal best scores but hit a wall at around 7.1-7.3Ghz and ran out of time due to depleted LN2. So what did I learn from my first 2 sessions on LN2? Well #1 is set fewer targets. It's impossible to bench everything and score well, so as you can see below I scored some PBs but mostly I could have done better on each benchmark if I focussed FREE GAMES! Ok, now I have your attention - the /r/overclocking team is currently the fastest growing competitive overclocking team on hwbot, and I'd like to keep that up. Meanwhile, the AMD Rookie Rumble competition ( for new members just opened today, so I'd like to get some new people involved the only way reddit knows how - free games! #Prizes: For the highest overall competition rank - a steam game or pack of your choice costing. 
So I've been thinking and I think we should try organize a Dogecoin sponsored online overclocking competition on HWbot.org ( I think it would be a good idea to do so because these competitions do not require a large amount of DOGE to work and could give us small but valuable attention. We could easily end up having several thousand people hearing/reading about DOGE and the first 3 places will get at least 52,500 DOGE(From my wallet). Currently OC competitions Hey team, just a friendly note to any of the newcomers to HWBot and benching in general. I have noticed our submissions are very low, and since we are a brand new crew there are a lot of different reasons for this. Time is usually the biggest and I understand because obtaining information to improve your scores simply isn't as easy as googling "What Java version and Hotspot will maximize my ram usage and increase scores in HWBot Prime". I myself have spent countless amounts of time searching. The amount of people who do not know how hyperthreading works is appalling on BAPC. I see many (mostly false) mantras being thrown around which was started by someone who doesn't know what they are talking about. First, watch this: The saying that hyperthreading doesn't work for games is false. Look at any CPU charts for modern game and the i3 will have an hefty lead over the Pentiums. The reason why the difference between the i7 and the i5 in most games. 
Edit: Did some reconfiguring, couldn't drop voltage but it's y-cruncher 1b stable after a bit more tweaking and at a few more MHz so definitely sticking with this baseline, I should be able to deal with the heat, it's a bench system anyway. So for some benchmarking fun I put together an AM3+ system. Relevant parts are: - CAPTAIN 240 EX AIO - 2x4GB DDR3-2400 RipjawsX - Crosshair V Formula-Z - FX-4100 (currently, I’ve got other K10/Piledriver CPUs as well) Before I hammer this CPU for HWBOT. Thanks to the glorious r/OC Discord I decided it was time for me to go a ltitle further than just water cooling. So after doing some research, getting some cheap stuff to play around with and organizing a CPU and GPU pot(for future endeavors, some time in the next weeks hopefully) and finding someone with dry ice where I'm living it was finally time on Friday. The CPU pot: The Kingpin Cooling Dragon F1 Extreme Dark (https://i.imgur.com/kYKeYwn.jpg). A small but ridiculous hunk of metal Hey, I thought I'd maintain an up-to-date summary of news from Computex. ampnbsp; =========== Tuesday =========== ampnbsp; Chip Manufacturers ARM - Cortex A55 and A75 CPUs Anandtech ( Mali G72 GPU Anantech ( Video of the press conference (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tal3e0eiKaQ). # THIS A CONTINUATION OF THIS THREAD. SORRY FOR THE MESS, BUT I RAN OUT OF ROOM AGAIN (https://www.reddit.com/r/hardware/comments/4lpmmj/computex_megathread/) There is a lot of stuff, so feel free to ctrl+f search for stuff, I tagged all of the entries.

Pics After the Asus Rampage V Extreme tragically killed my 5960x with overvolting, I decided to go all in with my i7700k and try to run it lidless. It worked fine, except my waterblock mounting screws had a standoff that wouldn't allow the waterblock to make good contact with the die. 80+c in BIOS. :( So I relidded it for now. Before delid / relid I was struggling to run at 5.0@1.45v pushing 95C (https://www.reddit.com/r/overcloc. After I got done with the i7 7700k delid and couldn't get it to hit 5.0, I decided to give 2011v3 another go and dumped some of my tax return on a 6950x. I was able to get 4.45Ghz (35x127) stable at like 1.4v or so. Maybe could drop that to about 1.38 but I wasn't interested in running it at this speed for long anyway. The cache is pretty finicky on this chip so I didn't push it very far. Pretty happy with that. Anything over 4.4 is supposed to be semi-unicorn territory. I could probably </p>
