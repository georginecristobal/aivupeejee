First off, this artist is called The Haven, they released an EP in 2007 called ' Under the Bright Lights '  I've tried everything trying to track this album down, my friend actually found the vocalists facebook but it seems either he doesn't use facebook or he doesn't care. Either way, I found that on Itunes it exists, BUT. it's only available in Lebanon. No big deal right? just switch countries and buy the album. I switch countries, find out that you can't buy itunes gift cards in Lebanon.
