Hello everyone. I needed some help looking for two specific animations from when i was younger. The first one is between the year 1997 and 2004. The only clues i have are: It was shown on MTV back in the day during a special weekend dedicated to either electro/techno/rave Or animation.

Third: All i remember was someone sort of rapping ? a la William. ## Hello everyone. I needed some help looking for two specific animations from when i was younger.

A lot of folks seem to be looking for recommendations, so this might be a good chance to give your own! I'm going to start with me. for obvious reasons. First, a little about me: I've been listening to electronic music since 1996. Before that, I listened to a lot of hip hop like A Tribe Called Quest and De La Soul and similar, which lead to scratching and breaks. I went to my first rave in 1998.

Apocalypse Noir In 1996, a new sub-genre of jungle began to coalesce called 'techstep', a dirge-like death-funk characterized by harsh industrial timbres and bludgeoning 'butcher's block' beats.

Originally published as "Adult Hardcore" in The Wire #182 April 1999. If you live in London, perhaps you’ve scanned the FM spectrum and come to a halt at a pirate station whose sound you can’t quite finger or figure. It’s got House music’s slinky panache, but the rhythm’s wrong – too fitful and funked-up, and besides, there’s an MC jabbering over the top, Jungle-style. Maybe it’s Jungle, then – but then again, maybe not: too slow, too sexy. Sometimes it’s a bit like American R&B – except. The song had vocals that said "I am the creator" at periodic intervals. The sound was sort of generic dance techno from the 90's that integrated sound effects from classic trek (The doors, communicator sounds, red alert). My friend had it on a Dance Rave compilation CD that was yellow and had a yellow cover. It was the third song on the CD. None of this stuff helps me find it on Google and the friend cannot locate the CD nor remember the name of the song/compilation. The CD was purchased Alright, the first part of this story does not make me look good. I was 19, and I was about 2 days from fully moved out of my old apartment. I went to a rave in a pier warehouse on the waterfront in Seattle where I met this girl, some making out happened and we decided to leave 'for awhile' to go get it on. Went to my old apartment and had pretty good sex. Took too long getting back to the party, and her cousin is gone. This is 1996 or so, the era before cell phones, and her cousin Hello everyone.
