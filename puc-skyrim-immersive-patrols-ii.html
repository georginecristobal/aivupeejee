Данный мод расширяет геймплейную сторону и атмосферу игры Skyrim SE,  - Произведена реконструкция файлов и добавлен недостающий файл Immersive Patrols II - Textures.bsa. Adds immersive patrols of all factions across the map at regularly timed intervals. Both a standard and aggressive version are available. Whenever I try to quicksave, it won't save the game until I open any menu, such as chests, my inventory, pickpocketing, etc. It also happens with autosaves.

Info: I am using AFT I have unticked "NPC can not permanently die" "Force NPC post combat auto-heal" "Boost follower stats" etc I have ticked: "NPC no combat recovery" However, they are immortal. Only way to kill them is to tell them: "It is time for us to part ways" They will then be killable by any means. I really want some realism where they sadly 
One of the merchant patrols is just standing there not moving. I can interact with them, and they react to combat, but they don't "patrol". Anyone. I got into modding a week ago and it's been crash after crash and troubleshooting after that and when I finally get the game running, I crash as soon as I enter one of the most important parts of my mage run.

Immersive Patrols Hey guys, amp#x200B; Having some major issues with weapon speed - first I was getting the bow slow draw bug, which I seem to have fixed by installing the Apocalypse-Ordinator patch, however now I'm getting the opposite - my weapon speeds (both Bow and Melee weapons) are getting insanely fast. By using player.getav weaponspeedmult I'm getting values of 2.30. If I try to set it to 1.30 for example it instead increases the value. Generally by a value of 1 (2.30 -gt 3.30). Steam Workshop: The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim. Immersive Patrols adds a reasonable amount of Stormcloak, Thalmor, Imperial and Dawnguard patrols to Skyrim and a few Skaal, Reaver and Riekling patrols to Solstheim. These patrols often cross paths. Game will not load any further than main menu, if i hit Load or New game, the starting music plays but I am still stuck on the main menu. I checked my task manager and Skyrim was only using 50% of my computers memory at that time.

First it began with crashing whenever I'd approach Whiterun which quickly stopped after loading a save from 30 minutes before. Now it's changed to crashing whenever I leave whatever cave or dungeon I'm in and try to get to the main world map. Anyway, I'm terrible with stuff like this so I just wanted to know if there was anything someone much smarter than I could see that I'm missing.

As you can tell from the title, i have some structures that are conflicting with each other causing the structures to look weird. So far I have found that Falkreath and Winterhold has this problem which i suspect it belongs to the same mods. And probably even more than i have not discovered yet. One of the mod that is affecting Falkreath and Winterhold is Great Cities while the other one is unknown, so I wanted to make a post asking people what mod within my mod list that may be conflicting. For The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim on the PC, a GameFAQs message board topic titled "Warzones vs Immersive Patrols, A tale of two mods.". When I swing a weapon(one handed, two-handed, daggers), there is a white texture appears around the weapon, and it follows it through the whole swing animation. It happens both first and third person. it's really annoying because i use the ordinator mod with a perk that increases my speed attack, so whenever this ability activates, the white texture begins to cover my entire character and I can not see anything until i stop swinging the weapon. At first, I thought that this was normal. Immersive Patrols SE. Exotic Все файлы Exotic. Автор  Мод для Skyrim Special Edition,  возможно конфликт с Immersive Citizens - AI Overhaul.

So I've been playing Skyrim SE for quite some time and i had modded it quite a lot, i recently went and add a ton of mods and wanted to go for a new play through, long story sort i got a lot of crashes but i manage to get through to at least Race menu where it just crashes there, what i mean, game boots up i see Bethesda logo i go to menu go for a new game and as soon as i get in the LAL cell and race menu appears i crash, i would really like some help. And here goes my mod list my lootgtgt. Page 1 of 2 - Immersive Patrols causes Skyrim to crash. - posted in Skyrim Technical Support: Hi all, this is my first post here , Anyways, lets get to the point. I have a clean install of Skyrim, to which all my mods that I had previously installed work just fine, but whenever I install. 
Hi, I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask so if it isn't I apologise! It's been a long time since I've played or modded Skyrim, and I've recently downloaded a lot of mods for SSE. However when I try to run SKSE64 through Mod Organizer, the console opens and closes immediately. I've already ran LOOT through Mod Organizer, but since I believe I've tried all other fixes (downloading a previous depot, blocking Skyrim with the firewal etc), I'm now thinking it's a mod or load order problem. "Skyrim Immersive Creatures" добавляет множество новых существ для того, чтобы улучшить и разнообразить мир Скайрима. Over my countless hours of testing I have gone through thousands of mods at this point. Performance testing in Skyrim is a huge pain in the ass as you can be in the same exact spot look one direction have 90 fps + 40% headroom over 90 then look 90 degrees the other way and watch your fps plummet to under 90 it's pretty crazy in some areas. My overall testing is in several locations around the map and just going by average overall fps in the areas.

Passionate about something niche? Reddit has thousands of vibrant communities with people that share your interests. Alternatively Ever since I started modding my Skyrim SE the whole thing , while not unpleseant, has been an exercise in utter futility for me, troubleshooting problems that remained unsolved, doing fresh reinstalls updated, unistalled potentially unstable mods, having to ditch advanced characters to start fresh just to check is something was amiss because the freezes and crashes would simply not stop. But I have reach my proverbial limit. This will be the last time I will try to troubleshoot whats wrong.

I use NMM to do the managing, Loot to sort things out, and I do my best to read most instructions.

I've been using using iHUD (Immersive Hud) for quite awhile but I recently uninstalled it because my crosshair wasn't showing up and I thought that was the reason, turns out it wasn't.
